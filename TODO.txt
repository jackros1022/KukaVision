TODO

--> class OURCVFHEstimation <---
- add a function that plots histograms

--> class NewSceneStage <--- <---
- define how to manage multiple histograms

--> class KukaVisionStage <--- <---<---
- [ATTENTION] The search of model correspondences is done only for folders corresponding to object of reference scene. If there is an object that has to thrown away we don't know what kind of object it is (and we don't know the corresponding model in the DB, if it exists). It should be interesting to search the model type for outer objects too in order to know how to grasp them!!!

--> class ManagementStage
- add a routine in order to set the pose of outer objects
- add a routine in order to set the transformation matrix between kinect and kuka base
